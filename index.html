    <p style="color: #FFFFFF "> You have probably seen French bulldogs more and more in recent years. This is true for many people. French bulldogs have been rising in popularity at a significant rate this last couple of years. This is partly due to their small size which makes them great for tagging along. Even many social media celebrities have been seen with these dogs and have been uploading photos with them. </p>
    
    <p> Although they have been growing in popularity only recently French bulldogs didn't just come out of nowhere. French bulldogs have a history going back to the 1800s. </p>
    
    
    <p> <h2 class="class" id="classs">History</h2> </p>

  <p>
  Most people assume French Bulldogs are from France as the name suggests, but this is not entirely true. French Bulldogs actually originate from England. 
     </p>
  <p>
In the 1800s bulldogs were breed with smaller dogs creating the first French Bulldog. Thanks to the Industrial Revolution more people could afford to take care of pets, so pets including the French Bulldog became much more popular. 
  </p>
  <p>
  From England French Bulldogs moved to France with people like lace-makers who had lost their jobs thanks to the Industrial Revolution. In France they became even more popular and demand skyrocketed.     
  </p>
  <p>
  When American tourists went to visit France they fell in love with French Bulldogs and started bringing them to the United States. And this is how their popularity spread and became what it is today.   
  </p>
  <p> <h2 class="class">Why are they so popular?</h2> </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li> <h2>Their size </h2> <img src="https://www.tiny-teacup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Teacup_French_M1-e15715-1.jpg" width=300px > <br>French bulldogs size is one of the main reasons they are so popular. Their small and compact size allows them to be very good companions whenever going out. Unlike bigger dogs who cause many problems when going out, French bulldogs dont take up much space and are fairly calm making them more easily managable in constantly moving situations. Their size also allows them to be able to interact with children without hurting them.  </li>
      <li> <h2>Companionship </h2> <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2253/9875/files/frenchie_world_and_baby_large.jpg?v=1588802020" width=300px> <br> This little dogs make for very good companions because of their size and personalities. Most French bulldogs excluding their puppy stage are very calm and dont need much attention from their owner. They are fairly self sufficient making them perfect for someone who doesnt have much time or energy to be taking care of a dog all day. They like to lay down most of the day but if given the opportunity they can be very playful. They also tire fairly quickly so you dont have to take them on very long walks or play with them all day. And of course their size allows them to be taken to many places in case their owner needs some company.   </li>
        <li> <h2>Social media </h2> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TXqAuzioxr8/maxresdefault.jpg" width=300px> <br> Another main reason French bulldogs became so popular is thanks to social media. All over social media people started loving how these dogs looked and each time more and more people started buying them. It was a sort of trend, many social media influencers started getting these dogs and from there it spread like wildfire. They kept getting more and more famous online and now they are even social media accounts solely for the dogs. Some of these accounts have as many followers as famous influencers.   </li>
      <li> <h2>Adaptability </h2> <img src="https://nedrac.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Five-Tips-When-Relocating-Homes-With-Family-Pets-scaled.jpg" width=300px> <br> Finally French bulldos are very good at adapting to many situations. They can fit in a small house with many people. They dont take up much space you can give them a little corner in the house and they wont bother anybody. Also they are easy to take when moving to one place to another and will quickly settle in to the new place.</li>
